I need an electric fan
Let's exchange phone numbers
He has a fear of heights
Yoga makes you flexible
We vistied the art gallery
I'm going to the grocery store
They will harvest the crops soon
She gave me a big hug
We need to innovate to grow
He spent a year in jail
I'm a junior at my job
He's a senior manager
Can you lift this box?
Our dog is very loyal
He is the master of this skill
This size is medium
Minerals are good for your health
He has strong muscles
The ball got stuck in the net
That's an odd question
You can overcome any problem
Be patient, it will happen
This period is important
The answer is plain and simple
Don't pollute the air
She is pregnant with twins
He's a professor at the university
They provide help to the poor
That bird is vary rare
I recommend this restaurant
Can you repair this watch?
He wanted revenge
She has a round face
I'll make a salad for dinner
She screamed for help
Seize the moment!
The damage was severe
Her eyes shine with joy
It's a sin to waste food
The slope is steep here
