I feel nervous
I'm satisfied with that
I'm starving
These jeans fit well
It's absolutely delicious
There's nothing here
Can you tie this?
It's very humid today
Let's meet at noon
This soup is salty
I like her voice
The concert was amazing
Let's take a taxi
She wore a white hat
Can I get a refill?
Please fold the clothes
Take out the trash
That's unbelievable
The floor is slippery
Check the temperature
Don't play with fire
They met at college
What type is this?
They had an argument
That's awesome
Let's divide the tasks
human rights
I'm at the office
Where's my sock?
I forgot my textbook at home
We need a wide net
The answer is written above
Adjust the settings
I work at an agency
He adjusted the camera angle
Can you arrange this?
The house sold at auction
The company went bankrupt
Tighten your belt
They boarded quickly
