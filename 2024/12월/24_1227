The wall is made of brick
They explored the cave
Be careful with that chemical
She is a good citizen
Let's collaborate on this project
That's a major concern
discover the truth
The storm caused damage
He has diabetes
Avoid using that drug
Who will you elect?
She excels at work
The statement is false
His decision is firm
The coat is made of fur
I am grateful for your help
harmony of colors
He will host the event
What's the main ingredient?
Check each item carefully
I wonder who he is
He gave details
Let's split the bill
She felt pain
That news spread quickly
He felt shame
The lake is deep
It was incredible
The flavor is rich
We saw the sunset
There was a traffic jam
single figures double figures
Total cost: $50
Don't flatter yourself
It's natural
My cousin and I are close
Be honest with me
We swam in the ocean
It's snowy today
The dog wagged its tail
