I bought a ticket for the concert
Can you spell your name for me?
The weather is nice today
I appreciate your help
We need a solution to this problem
I do my laundry on weekends
Is it true that you are moving?
I feel queasy after that ride
The traffic is terrible this morning
I'm allergic to pollen
I have asthma
I don't drink beer often
These pants don't fit me anymore
I rarely carry cash these days
I rarely watch TV these days
I stayed home alone yesterday
They always support my dreams
I'm afraid of heights
I was disappointed with the movie ending
I was impressed by her singing
He's in a good mood today
Don't be scared
Switch your phone to silent mode
He depends on his friends a lot
I heard a strange sound last night
They will arrive at 7 PM
Call 911 in an emergency
Childern have vivid imaginations
Turn left at the next intersection
It's very windy outside today
Let's meet at a quiet place
She went shopping at the mall
This blanket is so cozy and warm
Be careful not to slip
Please sign the document
After his run, he felt so energetic
Let's invite our friends to the party
The fridge is empty
Can you help me clear this mess?
I need to change the tire
