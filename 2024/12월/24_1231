I write a journal every night
I love lamb skewers
My English level is basic
a local market
He has good manners
She measured her height
The curry is mild
Do you have some money?
Water is necessary to live
Nuclear energy is clean
Her talent is outstanding
Passport please
He earns %50 per hour
She trained to become a pilot
He was a poet
She used garlic powder
What's the price?
real estate property

It's a recent photo
He rejected the offer
respond to a question
Roll up your sleeves
a rural area
Leaves scatter in the wind
Our system is secure
They serve good food
egg shell
The library was silent
a slice of pizza
We are members of society
Do you have a spare pen?
He enjoys playing sports
She tripped on the stage
a steam iron
Let's discuss our strategy
I saw a submarine at the museum
a smooth surface
symphony orchestra
The meat was so tender
