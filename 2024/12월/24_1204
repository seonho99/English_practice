I feel the same way
Get to the point
How come?
Fair enough
Keep it up
Don't take it personally
I told you so
Are you with me?
What's on your mind?
No big deal
That's the way it is
Are you messing with me?
You nailed it
It's gonna be epic
What's up?
It's been a long day
That's odd
Let's call it even
That would be great
Catch you later
That's what I'm talking about
What was it like?
Where were we?
Watch out
That's out of the question
What time do you start work?
What time do you get off work?
It doesn't matter
How's the food here?
What is that thing?
It's now or never
Couldn't be better
I didn't mean it
I'm down with that
It's up to you
You have my word
Just between you and me
What's the plan?
That's for sure
What am I gonna do?
You are on your own
Come on in
You shouldn't have
Shame on you
I'm telling you
I'll pass
Anybody here?
Speak up
That's a good one
I feel like doing nothing today
