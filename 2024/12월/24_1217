My brother is a soldier
Light has a color spectrum
She sprayed water on the plants
I need a stamp
The flower's stem is long
Tie it with a string
Hard work leads to success
He survived the accident
Aim at the target
Let's meet at the bus terminal
I'll come though it's late
The baby is in the stroller
They will transfer the files
Squeeze the tube
Wait until I come back
This is the lastest version
We need a strong vision
The wave is huge
Which one do you like?
This sweater is made of wool
I hope you sleep well tonight
She hasn't arrived yet
My dad loves to play golf
He is still single
Success is my favorite word
The police gave me directions
Please sit here
Could you hand me the book?
This cake tastes great!
He couldn't hide his anger
I really miss our time together
He couldn't believe his eyes
Is there a store nearby?
He's too shy to talk to her
What is this movie about?
Let's skip this question
That's enough food for me
She sat in the front row
I need to see a dentist
Please hang your bag here
