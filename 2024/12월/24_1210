The bandage was too tight
Let's sit in the shade
These shoes are too tight
It's my usual order
Can you button my shirt?
She gets impatient quickly
Did you take your medicine?
The old book is dusty
The sky is so blue today
Be careful not to drop it
Don't hesitate to ask
My budget is tight this month
I got a gift from my friend
His eyesight is very sharp
She is very smart
Where is the exit?
He's a very humorous person
Do we have cooking oil?
This blanket is so soft
We went to the theater last night
My wife is at home
He was absent yesterday
I admire your courage
What is your aim?
Today is our anniversary
The police will arrest him
The audience clapped loudly
He leaned on the bar
Let's sit on the bench
The water will boil soon
That idea is brilliant
The ceiling is very high
He has a pain in his chest
Every started to clap
The building could collapse
We need concrete evidence
The two cars crashed
They had a heated debated
The dialogue was interesting
She's a dynamic leader
