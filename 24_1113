Are you ready to go?
I know how you feel
Hope to see you again
The rainy season has started
I need to go home
I was late for work
How old is your son?
I'm not picky about food
I have a pollen allergy
Let's go for a drive
I like it a lot
I'm not mad at you
The bus is coming soon
I got a health check-up
Do you like spicy food?
I like to eat out
I don't want to know
Let's go for a walk
Sit in the front seat
I'm used to this stuff
It's time to get up!
You're going to be late
I stayed up all night
Can you pick me up?
I want to be alone
Can I have some more?
I have a date today
Can I talk to you?
Are you talking to me?
I had my hair cut
Could you say it again?
Do you have a hoddy?
I like to watch movies
Do you have a charger?
I'll think about it again
May I use your pen?
She has a British accent
I live in an apartment
He's really good at cooking
I eat bananas for breakfast
It needs a new battery
I had a great time
Is the Wi-Fi working here?
How long will you stay there?
Ny leg bone is broken
Where did you buy it?
You should wear a helmet
Let's go to a concert
Turn left at the corner
They are a lovely couple
We dated for two years
Can you play the piano?
I need a dry towel
This is not the end
It's too far to walk
I'll call you back later
What time works for you?
We have to keep trying
This is the first time
How do you know that?
Do you have a minute?
Let's go on a trip
