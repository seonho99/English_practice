How much is it?
What did you say?
I love your hairstyle
Let's wait and see
Thanks for the ride
It takes an hour
Where are you from?
I got a cold
Please dye my hair
Have a nice day!
I'm ready to go
I didn't do that
Do you need anything?
Give it to me
I have a fever
It's all my fault
It's hard to say
I'll do my best
I got a haircut
I can't digest well
I'll let you know
I'd like to order
I'm used to it
Let's have a drink
When are you free?
Say hello to Jeff
Why are you upset?
I'll have the same
Things will work out
I have no appetite
I have an appointment.
It's easy to say
Make yourself at home
I have a question
I'm angry at her
I have a plan
I need some advice
How far is it?
This has gone bad
How do I look?
How was your day?
I am so touched
I'll be right back
Give it a try
I can't afford this
What's the temperature today?
I'm trying my best
It might rain tommorrow
I bumped into him
I will take this
When is your brithday?
What do you prefer?
Smile for the camera
It looks very nice
It's really a bargain
It poured all day
Hold on a sec
Please don't rush me
Leave it to me
I have an idea
It is very hot
Tell me what happened
What's the date today?
She is my age
You take them all
I'd like on more
I hope it's sunny
Show me the ticket
My name is Jennie
Is it raning now?
Do you work here?
Which one is yours?
She's on the phone
Let's split the bill
Thank you for waitingz
