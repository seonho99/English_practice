Please leave out the cilantro
I got it free
Don't worry about it
It's a long story
I just dropped by
Can I have a seat?
Did you quit smoking?
I kicked the habit
I can do it by 2
Who said that?
How did it go?
How was the movie?
It's disgusting!
I need medicine
Anytime works
Don't be ridiculous
I apologize
It was close
I'm allergic
I slept like a log
Did you see a doctor?
I'm at work
It's because of stress
Let me think about it
Did I sleep wrong?
I hate getting old
Are you okay?
Put these away, please
It's not a big deal
You got this!
Tell me more
It was a mistake
Do you have decaf?
Slow down, please
Count me in
I'm curious
Are these for sale?
Call me if you're late
Maybe later
Can you cook at all?
Grab another slice
I have to work late
Here's to us
It's been a crazy week
What is so funny?
We need to leave soon
Don't drag your feet
I'm almost ready!
Step back, please
I was sick today
