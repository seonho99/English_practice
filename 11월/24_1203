Coming through
That's my jam
It's not my thing
Wanna split it?
Wanna grab some food?
Take a wild guess
What do you wanna do?
It's a long story
Are you coming?
You know what?
I mean it
I'm on my way
I'm seeing someone
Easy for you to say
My bad
Chill out
That's enough
Take that back
Could be
Don't overthink it
I have no choice
It's ridiculous
Here's the deal
I need some fresh air
Keep me posted
Just my luck
You name it
Come along
I couldn't agree more
That figures
Tell me about it
No doubt
You can't have it both ways
How did it go?
That's the way it is
I'm on it
That makes sense
So, what now?
I'm not buying it
What's going on here?
What am I missing?
Don't flatter yourself
I can't wait
You got me
Something's not right
So be it
This is gonna be awesome
Get it together
Just in case
Let's just chill at home
