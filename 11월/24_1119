Are you gonna come with me?
Are you gonna eat that?
Are you gonna go to the party?
Are you gonna stay home today?
Are you gonna bring your laptop?
Are you gonna work tommorrow?
Are you gonna drive or walk?
Are you gonna clean the house today?
Are you gonna make dinner?
Are you gonna go shopping?
Are you gonna send the email?
Are you gonna get a haircut?
Are you gonna join us for lunch?
Are you gonna study tonight?
Are you gonna take the bus?
Are you gonna tell her the truth?
Are you gonna bake a cake?
Are you gonna go for a walk?
Are you gonna buy the tickets?
Are you gonna be there on time?
I gotta go now.
I gotta get back to work
I gotta make a call
I gotta finish this
I gotta run some errands
I gotta clean the house
I gotta pick up the kids
I gotta do the laundry
I gotta cook dinner
I gotta get some rest
I gotta find my keys.
I gotta study for the test
I gotta charge my phone
I gotta prepare for the meeting
I gotta get some groceries
I gotta buy a gift
I gotta fix the car
I gotta write an email
I gotta make a reservation
I gotta book my flight
