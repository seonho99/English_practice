How's your new job?
It's getting dark
I'm off today
I'm done
I'll be 10 minutes late
Are you sure?
How was work?
What if it rains tomorrow?
Where were we?
How's it going?
Do you have any plans?
I don't have time
I don't have any plans
Do you have kids?
I'm feeling lucky
You're a lifesaver
Turn up the volume
I feel dizzy
Did you have fun?
It's so sweet of you
Can you speak up, please?
Grow up
you can't park here
Did you bring a selfie stick?
I'll keep that in mind
It's so crowded
I need some rest
I'm not sure
I don't know for sure
I can't wait
I'm looking for a gift
I can't believe it
It's no one's fault
That'd be great
Stop nagging me
Tell me what to do
I'm doing well
Can I get a refund?
Do you have any pets?
I can't think of his name
Let's go grocery shopping
I'm familiar with this route
I'm sorry for the mess
What's your favorite food?
It's broken
It can't be true
I invited them
He lives next door
You have a fever
I need to talk to you
