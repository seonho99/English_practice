I'm outta time
I'm outta breath
We're outta milk
I'm outta energy
We're outta gas
He's outta luck
I'm outta ideas
They're outta control
I'm outta patience
I'm outta money
She ran outta excuses
We're outta coffee
It's outta my hands
The milk is outta date
You're outta options
I'm outta practice
I'm outta the loop
We're outta food
We're outta water
I'm outta batteries
We're outta space in the car
I'm outta excuses
We're outta toilet paper
I'm outta clothes to wear
He's outta time to finish the project
She's outta patience
We're outta tickets for the show
I'm outta strength to keep going
The car's outta fuel
I'm outta ways to fix this
I'm kinda tired today
It's kinda cold outside
I'm kinda hungry
She's kinda busy right now
I'm kinda nervous about it
This is kinda strange
He's kinda quiet today
I'm kinda excited for the trip
It's kinda expensive
I'm kinda in a hurry
