No, it's not mine
This smells amazing
I can't wait to eat
I've never used it
I can show you how
I forget my wallet
I'll pay for it
I'll treat you next time
Have you heard the song?
It's so catchy
I'll have a latte
It was a long flight
I bet you're tired
How can I get there?
You can take the bus
I'll check the map
I'm out of gas
I adore beef
I tripped in the street
I was embarrassed
I'll have coke
I'll order for us
Table for two, please
You're a good cook
I'll call you back
I'm out of battery
How's the lemonade?
It tastes tart
I'm listening
I'm happy to help
Where were you?
Did I snore?
It was terrific
I have nothing to say
I'll wait in the car
Are you free today?
Let's hang out
I'm out of time
Are you awake?
Shell we meet at 2 or 3?
Either works for me
When are you coming?
What happened?
When do you get off work?
Usually around 6
It's too hot
Can you drive?
I'm a beginner at driving
I had a great time
I'll stop by
It's too far to walk
We can take a taxi
Check your schedule
What's up next?
It takes a lot of time
Can I have a menu?
What's in our fridge?
Let me check
Don't forget your phone
It can't be
Is it far?
It's not that far
What does that mean?
I'll have the same
It's your turn
You're amazing
I stayed up all night
That's not healthy
I got it wrong
I was late for work
I will take you home
Where's the restroom?
It's up to you
It's very simple
Warm it up, please
