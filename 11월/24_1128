That's nonsense
How's the coffee?
Just in case
I feel loved
That looks good on you
I'll give it a shot
My mouth is watering
Can I get some water?
How's work?
I'm running late
I'm so excited!
What are you doing here?
Can I call you back?
I've had a long day
It has gone bad
What's your phone number?
I hope you're okay
I'm not ready yet
Watch out!
Here you go
I don't mind
Take your time
Have you eaten?
First come, first served
I got a haircut
I like your haircut
He's angry at me
I love to cook
It's so noisy
Just a minute
Don't mind me
I'm terrified
Are you getting married?
Make yourself at home
I had a rough night
How's the food here?
I'm not feeling well
Something came up
What's your last name?
Are you on your way?
I'm on my way
Thanks for everything
Who knows?
That's hilarious
I have to get to work
Fold the laundry
I got a flat tire
I'm really grateful
I'm looking for my phone
Look who's here!
As you want
We're almost there
I have a meeting
You're the best!
I'm in your neighborhood
How's the family?
Have a good one!
Maybe another time
That's not a problem
I'm in a hurry
It's a small world
Let me finish
I'm sorry about that
Safe travels
What's going on?
You're very talented
I heard the news
I'm so touched
He's reliable
I'm on a business trip
Put the toys away
Believe in yourself
I won't be late
Time's up
You'd better hurry
