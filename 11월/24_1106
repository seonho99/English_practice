You're so awesome
Tell me more
It's too salty
It's your mistake
Need some help?
I'm 100% positive
Take some medicine
Turn on the fan
She's my neighbor
I'm getting better
I'm seeing someone
Who's in charge?
That's worth reading
He seems friendly
I'm not sure
I'm an extrovert
I'm an introvert
Twice a week
I like comedies
I logged out
My stomach's growling
I'm terribly sorry
Wi-Fi doesn't work
You flatter me
I had a nightmare
The air is dry
I'm on a diet
Can you hear me?
Do you know me?
Do you feel better?
Where's the bus stop?
Where can I park?
I didn't know that
I really miss you
I paid with cash
Can I park here?
Just hear me out
I coughed so hard
I washed the dishes
I've got a headache
You're good at everything
Have a good time
It all tastes great
Are you leaving already?
How was your weekend?
I think you're right
I can't hear you
How are you doing?
It's better than nothing
I'm working on it
Don't get me wrong
I'm sorry I'm late
It's time for dinner
Do you like it?
I can't stop laughing
It's not your fault.
I agree with you
I haven't decided yet
What day is it?
Let's take a taxi
It's up to you.
The dinner was wonderful
Enough is enough
I have a hangover
I'm allergic to cats
Have a nice trip
It's made of gold.
May I go through?
This is for you
Are you in line?
Could you help me?
What are you doing?
How does it taste?
How's your family?
That's too bad
