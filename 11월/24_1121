It's kinda hard to explain
This palce is kinda cool
I'm kinda confused
It's kinda far from here
That sounds kinda fun
I'm kinda bored
It's kinda late now
He's kinda annoying sometimes
The movie was kinda boring
I'm kinda done with this
This food is kinda spicy
I'm kinda surprised you called
I feel kinda sick
That joke was kinda funny
It's kinda similar to that
I'm kinda confused about this
It's kinda like a puzzle
I'm kinda jealous
It's kinda a big deal
I'm kinda worried about him
I called in sick
It's just a cold
There are no seats
Let's wait a bit
Let's go elsewhere
He got accepted
That's fantastic news!
Go Grab a coffee?
It's stuffy inside
Let's air out
Open the windows
All set now
Great, let's go!
I'm on my way
See you soon!
I'll text you later
I love your style
Did you work out?
I went for a run
I don't feel like cooking
Let's order delivery
Is that true?
Shall we eat at home?
I don't mind
Is it yours?
