I'm stuffed
I'm starving
Let's order pizza
I'm down for pizza
Don't drink and drive
It's on me
I have a part-time job
The battery is dead
Do you come here often?
Put it in the fridge
That's in the freezer
That's a relief
Don't feel bad
This is fun
He is funny
I'm home
I'm bad with numbers
I don't have any cash
I'm self-employed
I'm a freelancer
I work in finance
I'm watching my weight
It's been a while
It's a beautiful day
I like your bag
What's your email?
What's the Wi-Fi password?
I'm off to bed
Sorry I was drunk
I'm sober
Good for you
This milk expires today
I have plans
Do you have plans tommorrow?
2 pm works for me
Does Friday work for you?
Can I tag along?
Where's the exit
I don't get it
I don't feel like talking
Can you hear me?
Text me
I don't like greasy food
More water?
It's going to rain today
Bring your umbrella
Where have you been?
You got this!
Back off, please
How was your weekend?
Do me a favor
What day is it today?
What's the date today?
Are you free later?
I need some advice
I'm under the weather
I'm looking forward to it
Can you pass me that?
I'm so proud of you
I can't help it
You're a fast learner
I'm sorry, I can't make it
I'm starting a new job
Drive safely
Stay strong!
I hope you understand
It's not for sale
Can you keep a secret?
Don't tell anyone
I need to save money
Don't give up
It's worth a try
It's not worth it
I didn't mean it
It makes sense
