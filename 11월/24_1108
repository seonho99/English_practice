What do you recommend?
It'll get better soon
Do you love him?
Do you remember me?
I went there twice
You are so kind
Is it still raining?
It's a long story
How about a drink?
It was my fault
I'm walking the dog
Let's check it out
I have no choice
I'm on my way
I have no idea
It's on your right
Let's take a break
What should I do?
My battery is dead
You can make it
Give me a hand
Put on your jacket
I am off today
What a nice day
What do you do?
You don't look well
You owe me one
I'm completely sober now
I like your shirt
That's all I need
Let's keep in touch
You did pretty well
What brings you here?
That's a good idea
We are good friends
There's nothing to eat
I'm an only child
Don't be so childish
I can't help it
I'm bored to death
I don't know exactly
I feel like shopping
I'll try my best
That reminds me
Long time no see
As soon as possible!
It's a chilly morning
It just came to me
Go straight this way
I'm on your side
Glad you like it
Time is running out
I grew up here
Don't cut in line
Have nice weekend
How have you been?
It's been a while
Is everything going well?
It's going too far
I rarely work out
You can't miss it
I'll look it up
It's small world
It's my first time
Get in the car
Give me one second
How tall are you?
I can speak English
The traffic is heavy
How's your business going?
Good to see you
It's windy and chilly
What time is it?
We're all for it
May I help you?
