Let's catch the next train
We have common interests
What's the difference?
She looks pretty
Can you keep a secret?
Is it correct?
He's our guide
My neighbor is nice
Get enough sleep
She studies every night
They love to travel
Please don't yell
We need to adapt quickly
His mood affects others
He stood out among the crowd
She appeared happy
Mosquitoes attacked us
He suddenly lost balance
This pen belongs to me
Blend the colors
Her brain is full of ideas
The carpet needs cleaning
She has a strong character
He smokes a cigarette
They mine coal for energy
Let's complete the task
They live in the countryside
Learn about different cultures
War can destroy cities
Drag the icon to delete it
He educates new employees
She wrote an essay
The fabric is soft
This is the final decision
Sleep is fundamental for health
She looked gorgeous
Use a hammer to nail it
The sun sets on the horizon
She's in the fashion industry
Don't isolate yourself
