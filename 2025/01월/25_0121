Any questions?
Keep it cool
Let's call it a day
Just checking in
How's the job search?
I like this
It's not too late
Mind the gap
Can I help carry?
I'll think about it
It's on the house
A piece of cake
I'll come over
I'm feeling lucky
Are you in pain?
I'll double-check
That's an order
You're exaggerating
It's under control
I'll wrap up here
Take a number
Stop the service
What a surprise
Mind your step
You're kidding, right?
I'm really tired
We should talk
Are you hungry?
That's complicated
It's works for me
I'm really sorry
So far, so good
Low on oil
Is this seat taken?
Such a beautiful view
Call me back
I'm stuffed
How's your sister?
Let's play a game
Did you get my email?
Take care of yourself
That was quick
Can I pet your dog?
You did a great job
Absolutely
What's your plan?
Very impressive
What's the temperature
Give me a call
You're a lifesaver
I like your style
Are you single?
Where are my keys?
It's a bit chilly
Give it a shot
Are you going out?
Stick with me
Turn up the music
Sign me up
Let's take a walk
Follow my lead
Safe and sound
No way
I love your dress
Let's take a selfie
Who's your friend?
Any thoughts?
Nice try
You're a natural
Grab a bite?
We need backup
How's the traffic?
We're stuck
I felt nervous
Are you allergic?
