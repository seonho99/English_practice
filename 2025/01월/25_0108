Easy as pie
I'm feeling fresh
I've heard enough
Come join us
It's very cheap
I'm so bored
Let's go uncover
Keep your promises
Anyone home?
Open it
Need a hand?
Give back
I'm on it
Is there a deal?
Let's go to work
I'm very invigorated
Listen up
I'm very resilient
Get out now
Fully booked today
Fix it
Heartfelt condolences
That's not funny
Dress warmly enough
Can I check the price?
Don't make me laugh
Ouch
Mark my word
Please slow down
Hurry up or we'll be late
It's not sweet
It's the best
Take a guess
It takes time
Make that two, please
I am aware of that
Check it out
You went too far this time
Stay out of trouble
It's next to the hospital
Back me up
Sold out
What brings you here
I am a little disappointed
That should help
Don't mess with me
Don't get too serious
It is painful for me
It makes sense
Don't be foolish
You have lost me
Don't push me
Sure, here you go
Don't be afraid
It's free
Sure
You stay out of it
How do you like here?
I like strawberries
That will be the day
See you later!
Give it a try
I enjoy the outdoors
I like math the most
I am impressed
Skip it
Where to go?
Drive safely
Awesome
How?
I don't believe
It's my turn
Very good
Get lost!
Please say that again
