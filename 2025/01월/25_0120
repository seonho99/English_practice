Which one?
Let's give him a big hand
Why?
Delicious
Please don't do that
Don't bother
What was the topic?
Here you go
You are soaked!
Go get it
Out of question
Don't push your luck
So soon?
No doubt about it
That's interesting
It's time to stop
What do you want?
I am broke
Definitely
Do you understand me?
Thanks for calling
Why do you say that?
This one?
That's already enough
Lucky you
I like your style
Are you single?
Where are my keys?
It's a bit chilly
Give it a shot
Are you going out?
Stick with me
Turn up the music
Sign me up
Let's take a walk
Follow my lead
Safe and sound
No way
I love your dress
Let's take a selfie
Who's your friend?
Any thoughts?
Nice try
You're a natural
Grab a bite?
We need backup
How's the traffic
We're stuck
I felt nervous
Are you allergic?
It's too dark
You're joking, right?
That's unfair
Time waits for no one
I'm relieved
That's so thoughtful
Lights out
Let's face it
What are your hobbies?
You're on fire
Change the channel
How's your mother?
Don't tempt me
Just perfect
Mind your own business
Settle the bill
You've made my day
Are you studying?
What a coincidence
You've got mail
Are you cold?
Check your pockets
Where were you?
Happy to help
How about a drink?
