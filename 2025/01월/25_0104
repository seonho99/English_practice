He looks ill
Any plans this weekend?
That song sounds familiar
She's very intelligent
He bumped his head
I have a cough
I like vegetables
Let's take the stairs
I feel fresh after scaling
I have some digestive issues
I got a bad sunburn
I don't have a choice
Nike is a famous brand
I'll do it myself
I prefer tea over coffee
She hurt her ankle
Did you win the lottery
I'll treat you next time
I'm bored
I need to take a shower
Don't tease your sister
I'm proud of you
I'm sorry for being late
She's a vegetarian
Be careful not to get hurt
It's not my fault
We'll move next month
It's freezing outside
Can you turn off the TV?
That's too expensive
I have yogurt for breakfast
Let's use the elevator
Let's meet up next week
The dog growled
Please fill out this form
There's an empty seat
Take a deep breath
He pointed to the clock
He's a rich businessman
I love to sit in the sunlight
