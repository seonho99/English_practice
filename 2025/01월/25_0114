Feels like old times
Do you have Wi-Fi here?
Take it easy
Are you free tomorrow?
It's written all over your face
Can I get refund?
Think twice
It's been pretty good
I enjoy japanese food
Have a good weekend
I feel grate today
You will do fine
It's been a long time
Do you take credit cards?
Take an umbrella
Do you eat breakfast?
Can I change my seat?
To go please
He has a big mouth
I like to read a book
Bring yourself
I'll be there in 10 minutes
Can I have a word with you?
I hope you get well soon
It's busy but good
I need more
Wash hands
Too expensive
Deadline is approaching
It's snowing today
Is it on sale?
I'm late help!
Where's lost luggage?
Is there a charge?
You're joking, right?
The sky is clear
It's so serene
Art inspires me
I'm hungry
You're so radiant
Book your tickets
I'm feeling nice
I'm feeling a bit dizzy
She's very sweet
It's very cold
She's very kind
I'm thirsty
Where's the taxi?
He's my brother
Where's the car rental?
It's very good
Everything tastes delicious
I love your outfit
I'm tired
Where's the concourse?
It's all yours
Come here
Guess who's back?
Let's go venture
Can I use the phone?
I'm very slim
Discover new hobbies
Forgive me
Can I get a ride?
Distance means nothing
What's the delay?
Relax now
Let's go roam
Hurry up please
Can I find help?
Can I see more?
I missed my flight
Goodbye now
I'm feeling jaunty
I'll keep learning
