It's disappeared
Get some rest
What a pity
I'm excited
I appreciate it
I'll try harder
Try it on
What's your favorite?
Is that right?
Get the picture
How tall are you?
That's my fault
I messed up
Are you working?
I'm so proud
What's the time?
It's impossible
Control yourself
What luck!
Follow me
Show me
I'm home
I promise
Buy it
Who's driving?
I'll treat you
That's terrific!
It's funny
Everyone does
Of course
You're special
Certainly not
You're lying
That happens
Just so-so
Feel better?
I won
Enjoy yourself!
I swear!
Afraid so
It's nothing
I quit
That's neat
Absolutely impossible
My pleasure!
Not bad
Here's why
Nothing serious
It's obvious
Slow down
Make a way
Keep an eye on this
No sweat
Please relax
Up to here
Who cares
That depends
You must be crazy
Time will tell
You are so careless
Never say die
Couldn't be better than this
Don't get into trouble
Welcome home
Thank God
I will get it
I am deeply touched
That's what I mean
Grow up
Nice talking to you
It's freezing
Excellent
Here is something for you
Tell me about it
Did you get it?
