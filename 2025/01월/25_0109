My battery's dead
I wish you all the best
Do you live alone?
I'm just looking around
The phone's ringing
Your Korean is very good
I love chocolate cake
Where is your hometown?
Don't make an excuse
Where's my shirt?
You do everything well
What's your favorite program?
Can I get there on foot?
I need to switch that light bulb
How are your parents?
There is a huge traffic jam
Have a happy Chuseok!
Stop nagging me
You look tired
Can I ask you a favor
My car won't start
Fortunately, no
Do you need a hand?
I need to charge my phone
What movies are playing?
Feels like old times
Do you have Wi-Fi here?
Take it easy
Are you free tomorrow?
It's written all over your face
Can I get refund?
Think twice
It's been pretty good
I enjoy Japanese food
Have a good weekend
I feel great today
You will do fine
It's been a long time
Do you take credit cards?
Take an umbrella
Do you eat breakfast?
Can I change my seat?
To go, please
He has a big mouth
I like to read a book
Bring yourself
I'll be there in 10 minutes
Can I have a word with you?
I hope you get well soon
It's busy but good
I need more
Wash hands
Too expansive
Deadline is approaching
It's snowing today
Is it on sale?
I'm late, help
Where's lost luggage?
Is there a charge?
You're joking, right?
The sky is clear
It's so serene
Art inspires me
I'm hungry
You're so radiant
Book your tickets
I'm feeling nice
I'm feeling a bit dizzy
She's very sweet
It's very cold
She's very kind
I'm thirsty
Where's the taxi?
He's my brother
Where's the car rental?
