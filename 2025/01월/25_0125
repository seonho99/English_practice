Where's the charger?
Catch you later
Good to see you
What's for lunch?
Give my best
Wait a minute
It was a great time
What did you do?
Where's the entrance?
It's really cheap
Do you remember me?
Did you sleep well?
Are you done?
What's the story?
How's it taste?
What a beautiful place
Time for a change
Can I have this?
Watch your language
Could you help me?
Will it take long?
Can you make it?
Enjoy your vacation
Need some help?
Is it nearby?
Are you coming?
Let's get to work
Are you alright?
Thanks for everything
How's your meal?
Can I see that?
Check this out
What does it mean?
Time's almost up
What's the issue?
Where's the bus stop?
How far is it?
Do you want to join?
What's your aim?
Have you decided?
I need a favor
Are you available?
Are you finished?
Where have you been?
What's the situation?
Can you elaborate?
Where should we meet?
Have you eaten yet?
Is it too late?
I'll catch up
You're so understanding
That's really creative
That's not ethical
You're so patient
Let's enjoy the moment
Let's try something new
That's so inconvenient
How about tomorrow?
Don't waste time
It's amazing
That's so inappropriate
Make it special
Let's try this
How do I proceed?
It's really heartbreaking
That's not worth it
Shall we meet?
Join us
I can't believe it
You don't have to
What happened to that?
Are you doing well?
Have a good time
Have a seat
Here it is
