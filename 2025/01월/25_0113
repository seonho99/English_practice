Don't make me laugh
Ouch!
Mark my word
Please slow down
Hurry up or we'll be late
It's not sweet
It's the best
Take a guess
It takes time
Make that two, please
I am aware of that
Check it out
You went too far this time
Stay out of trouble
It's next to the hospital
Back me up
Sold out
What brings you here
I'm a little disappointed
That should help
Don't mess with me
Don't get too serious
It is painful for me
It makes sense
Don't be foolish
You have lost me
Don't push me
Sure here you go
Don't be afraid
It's free
Sure
You stay out of it
How do you like here?
I like strawberries
That will be the day
See you later
Give it a try
I enjoy the outdoors
I like math the most
I am impressed
Skip it
Where to go?
Drive safely
AweSome
How
I don't believe it
It's my turn
Very good
Get lost
Please say that again
My battery's dead
I wish you all the best
Do you live alone?
I'm just looking around
The phone's ringing
You Korean is very good
I love chocolate cake
Where is your hometown?
Don't make an excuse
Where's my shirt?
You do everything well
What's your favorite program?
Can I get there on foot?
I need to switch that light bulb
How are your parents?
There is a huge traffic jam
Have a happy Chuseok!
Stop nagging me
You look tired
Can I ask you a favor
My car won't start
Fortunately no
Do you need a hand?
I need to charge my phone
What movies are playing?
