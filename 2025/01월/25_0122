It's too dark
You're joking right?
That's unfair
Time waits for no one
I'm relieved
That's so thoughtful
Lights out
Let's face it
What are your hobbies?
You're on fire
Change the channel
How's your mother?
Don't tempt me
Just perfect
Mind your own business
Settle the bill
You've made my day
Are you studying?
What a coincidence
You've got mail
Are you cold?
Check your pockets
Where were you?
Happy to help
How about a drink?
Any questions?
Keep it cool
Let's call it a day
Just checking in
How's the job search?
I like this
It's not too late
Mind the gap
Can I help carry?
I'll think about it
It's on the house
A piece of cake
I'll come over
I'm feeling lucky
Are you in pain?
I'll double-check
That's an order
You're exaggerating
It's under control
I'll wrap up here
Take a number
Stop the service
What a surprise
Mind your step
You're kidding, right?
I'm really tired
We should talk
Are you hungry?
That's complicated
It works for me
I'm really sorry
So far, so good
Low on oil
Is this seat taken?
Such a beautiful view
Call me back
I'm stuffed
How's your sister?
Let's play a game
Did you get my email?
Take care of yourself
That was quick
Can I pet your dog?
You did a great job
Absolutely
What's your plan?
Very impressive
What's the temperature?
Give me a call
You're a lifesaver
