Got it
Remember me
I'll never forget
You're very tenacious
Cut it out!
Choose wisely now
Where's the flight?
Let's go to the concert
Don't be sharp
How's everything going?
Can you wait, please?
I'm fine
It's so small
Let's go to the cafe
It's very quiet
Sorry, can't make it
What's the intent of?
He's very innovative
I'm quite invigorated
I'm feeling energetic
I'm very young
I'm feeling fine
You got this!
Any shops open?
I'm on the fence
Easy as pie
I'm feeling fresh
I've heard enough
Come join us
It's very cheap
I'm so bored
Let's go uncover
Keep your promises
Anyone home?
Open it
Need a hand?
Give back
I'm on it
Is there a deal?
Let's go to work
I'm very invigorated
Listen up
I'm very resilient
Get out now
Fully booked today
Fix it
Heartfelt condolences
That's not funny
Dress warmly enough
Can I check the price?
It's disappeared
Get some rest
What a pity
I'm excited
I appreciate it
I'll try harder
Try it on
What's your favorite?
Is that right?
Get the picture
How tall are you?
That's my fault
I messed up
Are you working?
I'm so proud
What's the time?
It's impossible
Control yourself
What luck
Follow me
Show me
I'm home
I promise
Buy it
Who's driving?
