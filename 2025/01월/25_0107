I need more
Wash hands
Too expensive
Deadline is approaching
It's snowing today
Is it on sale?
I'm late, help
Where's lost luggage
Is there a charge?
You're joking, right?
The sky is clear
It's so serene
Art inspires me
I'm hungry
You're so radiant
Book your tickets
I'm feeling nice
I'm feeling a bit dizzy
She's very sweet
It's very cold
She's very kind
I'm thirsty
Where's the taxi?
He's my brother
Where's the car rental?
It's very good
Everything tastes delicious
I love your outfit
I'm tired
Where's the concourse?
It's all yours
Come here
Guess who's back?
Let's go venture
Can I use the phone?
I'm very slim
Discover new hobbies
Forgive me
Can I get a ride?
Distance means nothing
What's the delay?
Relax now
Let's go roam
Hurry up, please
Can I find help?
Can I see more?
I missed my flight
Goodbye now
I'm feeling jaunty
I'll keep learning
Got it
Remember me
I'll never forget
You're very tenacious
Cut it out!
Choose wisely now
Where's the flight?
Let's go to the concert
Don't be sharp
How's everything going?
Can you wait, please?
I'm fine
It's so small
Let's go to the cafe
It's very quiet
Sorry, can't make it
What's the intent of?
He's very innovative
I'm quite invigorated
I'm feeling energetic
I'm very young
I'm feeling fine
You got this
Any shops open?
I'm on the fence
