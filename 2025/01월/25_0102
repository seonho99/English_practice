He's on vacation now
We had fun at the beach
Can I take your order?
He asked for help
Kids love to play outside

It's my favorite season
The movie lasted for two hours
Hopefully, it won't rain tomorrow
The entrance is on the left

He bumped his elbow
Fingers crossed!
Never mind
Let's go to the shop
He got promoted at work
He solved the problem easily
