I have a toothache
What religion are you?
Are you listening to me?
It's cold get a blanket
Can you pinch me?
She twisted her ankle
We won the race
Think positive
Death is a natural part of life
I go to the gym every morning
Move forward step by step
Don't worry, just relax
She was speechless
This book is worth reading
Why did this occur?
The movie was hilarious
Let's take a shortcut
It's pouring outside
deal with stress
It's too noisy in here
Are you ready to go out?
Dad often cooks dinner
Don't touch the hot pan
Fill it up, please
It seems possible
Our team won the game
This is my first time here
Let's meet at the cafe
His computer is slow
I need to clean my desk
I had the flu last year
Wear your mask outside
Car insurance is important
She often travels overseas
Don't bite your lip
Let's not gossip about others
She smiled warmly
The dog barked loudly
He'll speak second
She'll graduate next spring
