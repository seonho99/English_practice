It makes sense
It's really hot
Try calling again
I'll make it
Honestly, I forgot
I'm not sure about it
I'm feeling terribly sad
Let's go explore
Can I join you?
I'm just kidding around
I'll be there soon
I'll close it
I'll be home late
It's very sharp
Health is wealth
Any airport shuttles?
Can you fix this?
He's my father
Any rental services?
Where's the ticketing?
Can I find a cab?
How much is this?
It's very insightful
I don't get it
Let's take a walk
I like sunny days
I stayed up all night
My wife is pregnant
I'll be back in no time
Could I get a refill, please?
I have a toothache
I don't remember the password
It works
That sounds like a good idea
Could you give me your business card?
I'll catch up with you
I am on a diet
Look on the bright side
It's not the best
Easy does it
It's free of charge
How much is the admission?
Are you all set?
I have a flat tire
Treat us
Can I have a wet towel?
I maxed out my credit card
That make sense
It's sunny today
Be on time
The night is still young
I like mashed potatoes
Are you pissed off?
There is a traffic accident
He drinks like a fish
I've got a headache
I really miss you
I am not sure yet
I did it
What should I do?
I have a friend traveling with me
I'm sorry that you're sick
I made a reservation under Amy
Everything tastes great
I like a caramel latte
My wallet was stolen
It's awesome
I just need to check-in
I am very thirsty
Are you leaving already?
What is your plan for tomorrow?
That's disgusting
Let's find it out
We are a family of four
Can you give me a ride?
