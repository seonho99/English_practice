Thank you very much
You're welcome
I'm sorry
That's alright
Excuse me
It's really late
Let's watch TV
I lost my phone
Have you seen it?
I don't think so
I'm on a diet
Don't be silly
Let's laugh
Are you finished?
It's a promise
It's very tasty
Keep in touch
That's too much
I'm very relaxed
I need some air
He's so tall
Mind the gap
She's very pretty
It's time to go
Do you have change?
I'm so lucky
I'm very cold
Don't forget
It's okay
It's a date
Watch your step
You're correct
What's your choice?
You look great
Are you busy?
What a day
Turn down the volume
Any news?
Come this way
Can I pay with a card?
How can I help?
Drive safely
Have a good trip
I need directions
Where should I eat?
Call me tomorrow
Did you find it?
Are you feeling better?
Can you fix this?
Almost there
I like sunny days
I stayed up all night
My wife is pregnant
I'll be back in no time
Could I get a refill, please?
I have a toothache
I don't remember the password
It works
That sounds like a good idea
Could you give me your business card?
I'll catch up with you
I am on a diet
Look on the bright side
It's not the best
Easy does it
It's free of charge
How much is the admission?
Are you all set?
I have a flat tire
Treat us
What's this called?
It's very hot
I'm very cold
Look at that
What happened?
