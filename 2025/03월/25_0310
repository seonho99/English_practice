It's pretty cold
I'm really busy
I'll call you
What did he say?
I can't hear you
See you later
What's the matter?
What a view
I'm on holiday
Let's make a plan
I have a reservation
Turn down the volume
It's very clean
I'm in charge
I can't sleep
Who's next?
I'm not ready
Don't be scared
What's the score?
I'm very worried
I'll tell you
It's my treat
It's very dirty
I'm very hungry
What a joke
What was the topic?
Hold it
Here it is
Are you coming?
Where should we meet?
You're incredible
Don't be silly
Do I look all right?
Stay calm
Keep me posted
Please speak slower
How are things going?
That's so cool
You're on fire
How big is it?
That's quite impressive
I have no clue
Can you speak louder?
Come on in
Delicious
Can I have a wet towel?
I maxed out my credit card
That makes sense
It's sunny today
Be on time
The night is still young
I like mashed potatoes
Are you pissed off?
There is a traffic accident
He drinks like a fish
I've got a headache
I really miss you
I am not sure yet
I did it
What should I do?
I have a friend traveling with me
I'm sorry that you're sick
I made a reservation under Amy
Everything tastes great
I like a caramel latte
Let's go home
This is delicious
It tastes bad
I don't care
Are you ready?
Not yet
Hurry up
I'm coming now
Say it again
I forgot it
