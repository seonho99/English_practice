Happy birthday
See you tomorrow
Have a safe trip
I miss you
Call me later
What's your number?
It's raining outside
I'm really tired
Take a break
Come here, please
Don't do that
I love you
How much is it?
It's too expensive
I can't afford it
I'll pick you up
Let's go there
It's amazing
I'm very proud
Let's take a break
I'll fix it
I don't understand
He's so handsome
I'll send it
It's very beautiful
Let's study together
Do you know her?
I have to go
Have you eaten?
Don't be shy
Who's that girl?
I need more time
What a day
Let's hang out
It's a deal
It's beautiful day
Is this yours?
I changed my mind
That's a big deal
What are your plans?
Good morning
Anything else?
What's for dinner?
Haven't arrived yet?
Are you lost?
Say it out loud
leave a message
Are we there yet?
Thank you
We're late
Pick up the phone
Are you tired?
Call me later
I'm coming
Make a decision
I got your message
What's next?
That's so romantic
Stay focused
I'm on your side
It really bothers me
You're late
I miss you
What's your aim?
Do you have WiFi?
I'll handle it
I'll do my best
Not bad
That's embarrassing
Nice try
Nice meeting you
Any news?
We have a problem
I have a long way to go
You're hilarious
