What's wrong?
Nothing special
Take your time
It's very useful
You did great
What a game
I'll be quick
Let's take turns
I'll call him
Let's not fight
I'll grab coffee
I'll fix it
I'm very busy
You're too kind
I'll clean up
It's really important
They're always together
How about tomorrow?
We're out of milk
Let's do this
It's my treat
They're laughing
I'll wait outside
I'm very sleepy
I've missed this
Let's sit here
I've finished it
Let's share it
I have a headache
Are they coming?
I've got it
How much longer?
We're out of time
Save your money
Let's run
It's very close
We'll see
It's a secret
I'm so nervous
Close the window
I've lost my way
What a relief
I'll be there
It's very far
Check it out
What did you buy?
It's his birthday
Keep the change
I'm not interested
Do you remember?
Let's chat
Don't be rude
Do you accept credit cards?
It's all set
I'm in love
Keep it up
That's so cute
Give me five
I'm very bored
Let's split it
I made a mistake
Have a good day
I feel bad
I'm really sorry
I promise
I'll pick you up
Let's go there
It's amazing
I'm very proud
Let's take a break
I'll fix it
I don't understand
He's so handsome
I'll send it
It's very beautiful
