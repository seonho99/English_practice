Easy as pie
I'm feeling fresh
I've heard enough
Come join us
It's very cheap
Let's work together
It's too heavy
I've changed my mind
Write it down
She's very talented
We need to talk
I'm not sure
It's perfect
Are we lost?
I'm on my way
Is everyone here?
It's too sweet
Lock the door
It's a bit salty
Let's meet up
It's so funny
Don't mention it
I feel great
Turn off the light
Mind your own business
Keep going
It's a deal
What's that noise?
I need advice
It's my turn
I can't find it
Leave it to me
Time's up
I don't agree
It's not fair
Give me a chance
Who is he?
Be quiet
I trust you
It doesn't matter
Do you mind?
Let's get started
He's my friend
I'm very thirsty
What's for dinner?
Just in time
He's very kind
Count me in
What's the matter?
It's a secret
How ridiculous
They're everywhere
I'll order food
It's quite rare
I'm almost ready
She's very busy
I've heard enough
You're always late
You made it
Time to leave
Take the lead
I've moved on
She's really smart
That's quite impressive
We'll be fine
I hate drama
Love conquers all
Time heals everything
You're very patient
Let's get moving
It's unbelievable
No worries
I feel awkward
Take the risk
She's very motivated
