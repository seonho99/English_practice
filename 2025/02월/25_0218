Let's sit here
I've finished it
Let's share it
I have a headache
Are they coming?
I've got it
How much longer?
We're out of time
Save your money
Let's run
It's very close
We'll see
It's a secret
I'm so nervous
Close the window
I've lost my way
What a relief
I'll be there
It's very far
Check it out
What happened to that?
Are you doing well?
Have a good time
Have a seat
Here it is
Can you come?
Don't mention it
Look here
What is the distance?
Please stop
I understand
Just curious
Let me know
That's a good plan
Too bad
Let's go on a trip
You're the one
That's so romantic
I'm so sorry
You're an angel
Raise your hand
I'm speechless
That's not safe
What are your hobbies?
Please go ahead
May I take your order?
Please join us
Time will tell
Long wait?
Come and get it
It's going smoothly
I'll be back soon
Just one more
It's messy
Good luck
I feel the same way
Don't feel bad
Could you repeat?
What's the rush?
Let's take a vote
It's a nice day
Goodbye
I am sorry to hear that
Can I try it on?
Are you Korean?
Happy New Year
I can't hear you
I like mangoes
No, mine is blue
Have you ever been to Canada?
Please clean my room
Yes please
How much is this?
Could you write it down here?
It's better than nothing
