It's your call
I'm on board
Time flies
We should go
Not a chance
What a day
That's strange
Mind your business
Sounds great
Hold my hand
I'll check
It's his mistake
Don't be lazy
Just be yourself
It's not true
Any plans today?
It's too much
I feel weird
He's really tall
You're my hero
It's really cold
Don't be upset
It's all good
I'm on break
Don't overthink it
I'm in pain
We're running late
He's so arrogant
Time for bed
Don't be mean
See the difference?
It's just perfect
Watch your words
I need guidance
Don't be greedy
I'll be honest
Just wondering
I need sleep
Are you full?
It's too complicated
Let's be dynamic
It's very stimulating
Keep the motivation
I'm very zealous
You're so radiant
That's very mesmerizing
Let's be resilient
I'm passionate
It's quite delightful
You're very diligent
Let's be tenacious
I'm very eager
It's quite compelling
You're very fervent
Let's stay zealous
I'm truly ecstatic
It's very uplifting
Keep your promises
I'm very vibrant
That's very intriguing
Can you wait, please?
I'm fine
It's so small
Let's go to the cafe
It's very quiet
Sorry can't make it
What's the intent of?
He's very innovative
I'm quite invigorated
I'm feeling energetic
I'm very young
I'm feeling fine
You got this
Any shops open?
I'm on the fence
