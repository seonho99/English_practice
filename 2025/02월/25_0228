It might work
Where is the ticket office?
It's absurd
Follow your instinct
I'll finish it
Where's my luggage?
Can I get assistance
It's not my thing
He's very funny
Please open the door
Can you hear me?
Can I view it?
I'm feeling a little dizzy
I don't understand you
I miss you so
Don't back down
I need some sleep
Is there a taxi?
Fasten your seatbelt
Have fun
I'm really sad
Can I sit?
Can I reschedule?
That's a great idea
I'll be right there
I'm feeling so tired
I'm not sure yet
Please wait a moment
I'll check it out
I'm so excited now
It's so profound
I'm feeling hot
I'll take care of it
I'm so sorry
I don't feel well
Let's go together tomorrow
It's very delightful
Can we talk later?
I'm not interested in that
Bring your friends
I don't like it
I'm not ready yet
I have no idea
Let's go for a walk
I can't wait anymore
I feel good
I'll be back soon
Any WiFi here?
That's very kind of you
Can you repeat that?
I didn't catch that
Why so serious?
That's not what I meant
Halfway done already
I'll try my best
I'm so hungry now
Can you explain it?
I'm lost here
Can I get food?
That's a piece of cake
Where can I pay?
I'm all ears
He's my son
You've changed a lot
I got promoted
Please take your time
I'm so excited
I'm ready to go
Let's call it a day
Can I cancel ticket?
Give them time
Eat healthier foods
What's the total?
Let's be eager
I'm eager to learn
