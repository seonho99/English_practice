Believe in yourself
I'm really impressed
Time is flying
He's really fit
I'll handle everything
It's my mistake
Follow your heart
You look amazing
I trust them
It's so refreshing
Let's be diligent
I'm quite zealous
You're very tenacious
Let's be fervent
I'm very enthralled
It's very enticing
Keep the enthusiasm
I'm quite invigorated
That's very stimulating
Let's be inspired
It's quite engrossing
You're very ecstatic
Let's stay fervent
I'm very elated
It's very delightful
You're very zealous
Let's be passionate
I'm quite ecstatic
It's very enchanting
You're very eager
I'm so bored
Let's go uncover
Keep your promises
Anyone home?
Open it
Need a hand?
Give back
I'm on it
Is there a deal?
Let's go to work
I'm very invigorated
Listen up
I'm very resilient
Get out now
Fully booked today
Fix it
Heartfelt condolences
That's not funny
Dress warmly enough
Can I check the price?
Keep going
It's a deal
What's that noise?
I need advice
It's my turn
I can't find it
Leave it to me
Time's up
I don't agree
It's not fair
Give me a chance
Who is he?
Be quite
I trust you
It doesn't matter
Do you mind?
Let's get started
He's my friend
I'm very thirsty
What's for dinner?
Just in time
He's very kind
Count me in
What's the matter?
It's a secret
