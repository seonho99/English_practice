How about coffee?
Is it ready?
Wait for us
What a surprise
Do it now
It's quite challenging
I've seen enough
It's raining again
You're so kind
We missed you
Keep the faith
What's your problem?
Don't be stubborn
I'll pay cash
Are they serious?
Mind your manners
Take the hint
Not right now
What's the point?
I feel blessed
It's very insightful
Keep the rhythm
I'm always punctual
It's really thrilling
Let's be active
I'm meticulous
That's so captivating
It's very intriguing
Stay at home
Let's stay motivated
I'm quite intuitive
Keep the spirit
It's so serene
You're very optimistic
It's a nice house
Let's be meticulous
I'm very invigorated
It's quite captivating
You're very vibrant
It's my destiny
What's the delay?
Relax now
Let's gp roam
Hurry up, please
Can I find help?
Can I see more?
I missed my flight
Goodbye now
I'm feeling jaunty
I'll keep learning
Got it
Remember me
I'll never forget
You're very tenacious
Cut it out
Choose wisely now
Where's the flight?
Let's go to the concert
Don't be sharp
How's everything going?
Do it later
Listen to this
I'll do it
I'm starving
What a coincidence
It's very clear
Don't be late
Let's have fun
I'll think about it
That's a good idea
Watch your step
What a mess
It's a gift
I need directions
That's so kind
