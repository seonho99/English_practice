Let's study together
Do you know her?
I have to go
Have you eaten?
Don't be shy
Who's that girl?
I need more time
What a day
Let's hang out
It's a deal
I'm on a diet
Don't be silly
Let's laugh
Are you finished?
It's a promise
It's very tasty
Keep in touch
That's too much
I'm very relaxed
I need some air
He's so tall
Mind the gap
She's very pretty
It's time to go
Do you have change?
I'm so lucky
I'm very cold
Don't forget
It's okay
It's a date
See you later
What's the matter?
What a view
I'm on holiday
Let's make a plan
I have a reservation
Turn down the volume
It's very clean
I'm in charge
I can't sleep
Who's next?
I'm not ready
Don't be scared
What's the score?
I'm very worried
I'll tell you
It's my treat
It's very dirty
I'm very hungry
What a joke
It's your call
I'm on board
Time flies
We should go
Not a chance
What a day
That's strange
Mind your business
Sounds great
Hold my hand
I'll check
It's his mistake
Don't be lazy
Just be yourself
It's not true
Any plans today?
It's too much
I feel weird
He's really tall
You're my hero
It's really cold
Don't be upset
It's all good
I'm on break
Don't overthink it
