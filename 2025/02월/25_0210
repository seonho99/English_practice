I'm in pain
We're running late
He's so arrogant
Time for bed
Don't be mean
See the difference?
It's just perfect
Watch your words
I need guidance
Don't be greedy
I'll be honest
Just wondering
I need sleep
Are you full?
It's too complicated
Let's be dynamic
It's very stimulating
Keep the motivation
I'm very zealous
You're so radiant
That's very mesmerizing
Let's be resilient
I'm passionate
It's quite delightful
You're very diligent
Let's be tenacious
I'm very eager
It's quite compelling
You're very fervent
Let's stay zealous
I'm truly ecstatic
It's very uplifting
Keep your promises
I'm very vibrant
That's very intriguing
Can you wait, please?
I'm fine
It's so small
Let's go to the cafe
It's very quiet
Sorry, can't make it
What's the intent of?
He's very innovative
I'm quite invigorated
I'm feeling energetic
I'm very young
I'm feeling fine
You get this
Any shop open?
I'm on the fence
Easy as pie
I'm feeling fresh
I've heard enough
Come join us
It's very cheap
Let's work together
It's too heavy
I've changed my mind
Write it down
She's very talented
We need to talk
I'm not sure
It's perfect
Are we lost?
I'm on my way
Is everyone here?
It's too sweet
Lock the door
It's a bit salty
Let's meet up
You're so funny
Don't mention it
I feel great
Turn off the light
Mind your own business
