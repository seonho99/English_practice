It's going smoothly
I'll be back soon
Just one more
It's messy
Good luck
I feel the same way
Don't feel bad
Could you repeat?
What's the rush?
Let's take a vote
It's a nice day
Goodbye
I am sorry to hear that
Can I try it on?
Are you Korean?
Happy New Year
I can't hear you
I like mangoes
No, mine is blue
Have you ever been to Canada?
Please clean my room
Yes, please
How much is this?
Could you write it down here?
It's better than nothing
It's five o'clock
Which one do you like better?
I'm working on it
I want to go here
Do you like it?
I feel sick
Where's the exit?
We won the game
I read the book
Turn up the music
I'm so happy
How old are you?
Take care
I need some help
It's very difficult
Are you coming?
Not today
That's too bad
See you soon
Drive safely
Good morning
Good night
Don't worry
I'm very excited
I agree with you
I like sunny days
I stayed up all night
My wife is pregnant
I'll be back in no time
Could I get a refill, Please?
I have a toothache
I don't remember the password
It works
That sounds like a good idea
Could you give me your business card?
I'll catch up with you
I am on a diet
Look on the bright side
It's not the best
Easy does it
It's free of charge
How much is the admission?
Are you all set?
I have a flat tire
Treat us
Can I have a wet towel?
I maxed out my credit card
That makes sense
It's sunny today
Be on time
