It's five o'clock
Which one do you like better?
I'm working on it
I want to go here
Do you like it?
I feel sick
Where's the exit?
We won the game
I read the book
Turn up the music
I'm so happy
How old are you?
Take care
I need some help
It's very difficult
Are you coming?
Not today
That's too bad
See you soon
Drive safely
Good morning
Good night
Don't worry
I'm very excited
I agree with you
Let's sit here
I've finished it
Let's share it
I have a headache
Are they coming?
I've got it
How much longer?
We're out of time
Save your money
Let's run
It's very close
We'll see
It's a secret
I'm so nervous
Close the window
I've lost my way
What a relief
I'll be there
It's very far
Check it out
What happened to that?
Are you doing well?
Have a good time
Have a seat
Here it is
Can you come?
Don't mention it
Look here
What is the distance?
Please stop
I understand
Just curious
Let me know
That's a good plan
Too bad
Let's go on a trip
You're the one
That's so romantic
I'm so sorry
You're an angel
Raise your hand
I'm speechless
That's not safe
What are your hobbies?
Please go ahead
May I take your order?
Please join us
Time will tell
Long wait?
Come and get it
