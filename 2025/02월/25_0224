It's your call
I'm on board
Time files
We should go
Not a chance
What a day
That's strange
Mind your business
Sound great
Hold my hand
I'll check
It's his mistake
Don't be lazy
Just be yourself
It's not true
Any plans today?
It's too much
I feel weird
He's really tall
You're my hero
Just in time
He's very kind
Count me in
What's the matter?
It's a secret
How ridiculous
They're everywhere
I'll order food
It's quite rare
I'm almost ready
She's very busy
I've heard enough
You're always late
You made it
Time to leave
Take the lead
I've moved on
She's really smart
That's quite impressive
We'll be fine
You're the best
I'll be there
We lost again
That's the limit
I'll text you
We need more
I feel terrible
It's too loud
She said yes
Check your phone
What's your favorite?
You were right
She's not coming
Just trust me
I can't decide
It's on sale
Don't make noise
I've seen better
It's almost done
Let's go outside
I've been there
I'll handle it
I'm in trouble
What's his name?
It's my fault
That's a lie
Let's keep it
You seem sad
I hate Mondays
Not my problem
We made it
It's snowing outside
They're very noisy
I'll book tickets
How's it going?
