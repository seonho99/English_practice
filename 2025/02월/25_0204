Got it
Remember me
I'll never forget
You're very tenacious
Cut it out
Choose wisely now
Where's the flight?
Let's go to the concert
Don't be sharp
How's everything going?
Do it later
Listen to this
I'll do it
I'm starving
What a coincidence
It's very clear
Don't be late
Let's have fun
I'll think about it
That's a good idea
Watch your step
What a mess
It's a gift
I need directions
That's so kind
What's wrong?
Nothing special
Take your time
It's very useful
You did great
What a game
I'll be quick
Let's take turns
I'll call him
Let's not fight
I'll grab coffee
I'll fix it
I'm very busy
You're too kind
I'll clean up
It's really important
They're always together
How about tomorrow?
We're out of milk
Let's do this
It's my treat
They're laughing
I'll wait outside
I'm very sleepy
I've missed this
Let's sit here
I've finished it
Let's share it
I have a headache
Are they coming?
I've got it
How much longer?
We're out of time
Save your money
Let's run
It's very close
We'll see
It's a secret
I'm so nervous
Close the window
I've lost my way
What a relief
I'll be there
It's very far
Check it out!
What did you buy?
It's his birthday
Keep the change
I'm not interested
Do you remember?
