Let's eat now
I'm very tired
Don't spoil it
It's too cold
Call me maybe
What a game
I'll be quick
Let's take turns
I'll call him
Let's not fight
I'll grab coffee
I'll fix it
I'm very busy
You're too kind
I'll clean up
It's really important
They're always together
How about tomorrow?
We're out of milk
Let's do this
It's my treat
They're laughing
I'll wait outside
I'm very sleepy
I've missed this
We're in trouble
It's too risky
I'm so nostalgic
Can you explain?
I feel rejuvenated
Life's unpredictable
He's really confident
I'm truly sorry
That's very rare
Keep it down
It's so boring
Life is short
Let's be clear
Don't be jealous
I'll get ready
It's very tempting
I'm very content
Just take it
You're so thoughtful
Don't be selfish
I've been lazy
That's very unfortunate
You're a gem
It's too salty
I'm truly blessed
He's so consistent
It's not working
Keep your promise
I'm really hungry
Time is gold
I'm always here
Let's find out
It's very emotional
It's my hobby
We're so grateful
Just keep going
It's so detailed
Life is beautiful
That's so generous
Let's be real
It's so obvious
I've been reflecting
I'm so stressed
Let's be positive
It's very slippery
Keep the momentum
I'll really thirsty
He's very charismatic
Time is precious
I'll take notes
