How ridiculous
They're everywhere
I'll order food
It's quite rare
I'm almost ready
She's very busy
I've heard enough
You're always late
You made it
Time to leave
Take the lead
I've moved on
She's really smart
That's quite impressive
We'll be fine
I hate drama
Love conquers all
Time heals everything
You're very patient
Let's get moving
It's unbelievable
No worries
I feel awkward
Take the risk
She's very motivated
Believe in yourself
I'm really impressed
Time is flying
He's really fit
I'll handle everything
It's my mistake
Follow your heart
You look amazing
I trust them
It's so refreshing
Let's be diligent
I'm quite zealous
You're very tenacious
Let's be fervent
I'm very enthralled
It's very enticing
Keep the enthusiasm
I'm quite invigorated
That's very stimulating
Let's be inspired
It's quite engrossing
You're very ecstatic
Let's stay fervent
I'm very elated
It's very delightful
You're very zealous
Let's be passionate
I'm quite ecstatic
It's very enchanting
You're very eager
I'm so bored
Let's go uncover
Keep your promises
Anyone home?

Need a hand?
Give back
I'm on it
Is there a deal?
