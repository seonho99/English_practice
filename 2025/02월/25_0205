Let's chat
Don't be rude
Do you accept credit cards?
It's all set
I'm in love
Keep it up!
That's so cute
Give me five
I'm very bored
Let's split it
I made a mistake
Have a good day
I feel bad
I'm really sorry
I promise
I'll pick you up
Let's go there
It's amazing
I'm very proud
Let's take a break
I'll fix it
I don't understand
He's so handsome
I'll send it
It's very beautiful
Let's study together
Do you know her?
I have to go
Have you eaten?
Don't be shy
Who's that girl?
I need more time
What a day
Let's hang out
It's a deal
I'm on a diet
Don't be silly
Let's laugh
Are you finished?
It's a promise
It's very tasty
Keep in touch
That's too much
I'm very relaxed
I need some air
He's so tall
Mind the gap
She's very pretty
It's time to go
Do you have change?
I'm so lucky
I'm very cold
Don't forget
It's okay
It's a date
See you later
What's the matter?
What a view
I'm on holiday
Let's make a plan
I have a reservation
Turn down the volume
It's very clean
I'm in charge
I can't sleep
Who's next?
I'm not ready
Don't be scared
What's the score?
I'm very worried
I'll tell you
It's my treat
It's very dirty
I'm very hungry
What a joke
