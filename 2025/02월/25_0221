The night is still young
I like mashed potatoes
Are you pissed off?
There is a traffic accident
He drinks like a fish
I've got a headache
I really miss you
I am not sure yet
I did it
What should I do?
I have a friend traveling with me
I'm sorry that you're sick
I made a reservation under Amy
Everything tastes great
I like a caramel latte
My wallet was stolen
It's awesome
I just need to check-in
I am very thirsty
Are you leaving already?
What is your plan for tomorrow?
That's disgusting
Let's find it out
We are a family of four
Can you give me a ride?
See you there
Let's go visit them
Have a nice weekend
I'm here for sightseeing
Let me see
Next time
Come up here
I'll show you
I lost my passport
What is the purpose of your visit?
It's a nice day
Goodbye
I am sorry to hear that
Can I try it on?
Are you Korean?
Happy New Year
I can't hear you
I like mangoes
No, mine is blue
Have you ever been to Canada?
Please clean my room
Yes, please
How much is this?
Could you write it down here?
It's better than nothing
It's five o'clock
Which one do you like better?
I'm working on it
I want to go here
Do you like it?
I'm on my way
I can't stop laughing
I don't have a boyfriend now
Sorry I'm late
It's hard to say
How long have you lived here?
They are over there
It's time for dinner
For here?
What do you mean?
Today is January 2nd
It's not your fault
I cannot say
Do you mind if I sit here?
I enjoy salsa dancing
There is tea
Would you like to come with me?
Let me guess
I'd like a glass of red wine
They are too large
