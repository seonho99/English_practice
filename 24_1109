Do I have to?
You did your best
So far, so good
It must be fun
You asked for it
I don't thiknk so
May I come in?
What should I bring?
Where do you live?
It was really close
Where are you going?
It's time to go
I'll show you how
I can't stand it
Did you get it?
It's okay with me
I feel much better
How was the food?
Do you know why?
I'm afraid I can't
I cut my finger
Can I come in?
Let's eat out tonight
How about this one?
I lost my wallet
I'm on my way
No, mine is white
I need a blanket
Join the badminton club
I burned my toast
I'll change my hairstyle
Don't bite your nails
What are you thinking?
My bedroom is cozy
September is almost over
I'll never give up
The weather is nice
I drank too much
It will be okay
I need your help
Let's have a party
I'm sweating a lot
I'll pay in cash
I'm a morning person
I didn't sleep well
I never skip breakfast
I can't believe it
I put on makeup
The room is messy
Clean up your room
I'm out of sugar
How was school today?
Are you done eating?
I need some rest
Thank you for coming
Do I look good?
I don't get it
I quit my job
I like to travel
What are we having?
Let's grab a bite
You look down today
I already ate lunch
I broke my arm
Ask him for help
I'll be missing you
Go away, I'm busy
She folded her arms
Bake for 20 minutes
The sunset is beautiful
I'm leaving early today
Let's begin the meeting
I believe you're right
Today is my birthday
Time to wake up
