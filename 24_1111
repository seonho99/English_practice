You are too much
Blood is coming out
The bottle is empty
I like this brand
I like bright colors
I'm coming with you
He started a business
I buy books online
The party is canceled
The chain is rusty
Sit on the chair
It's a good chance
It's like a dream
I pinched my cheek
The sound is clear
You only live once
The clock is broken
Close the door please
Fasten your seat belt
That's a big company
It's driving me crazy
I like my job
I need some time
Where is the restroom?
The sunglasses are cool
It's made of cotton
It's so much fun
My coworker is kind
Let me try it
The street was crowded
I can't catch you
No pain, no gain
Go to the dentist
My desk is messy
What do you think?
She is a docter
A dog is barking
Have a nice dream
I dropped the glass
The books are dusty
I wake up early
I didn't mean it
This puzzle is easy
I boilded some eggs
I bumped my elbow
We have enough time
Where is the exit?
This is my family
It looks so yummy
The weather is fantastic
I found my key
The tire is flat
The flower smells good
I'm free on Sunday
What do you mean?
Can you repeat that?
I don't really care
I'd rather not go
Who's going to cook?
There's been an accident
What if I'm wrong?
Is this on sale?
Sure, I'll do that
I didn't catch that
I think that's enough
Do me a favor
Let's forget about it
Can you speak slower?
I'm just killing time
Any message for me?
It's just a misunderstanding
That's a good question
Don't let me down
That's a good point
That's a tough question
